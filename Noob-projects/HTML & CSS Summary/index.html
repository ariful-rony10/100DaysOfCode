            <h2>HTML Summary</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the heart of every webpage. It defines the
            structure of the webpage and annotates the content to tell the browser what to
            display and provide extra meaning. Without HTML, text would always be "just text"
            - there would be no semantic difference between titles, normal text, subtitles etc.
            You also <strong>wouldn't</strong> be able to add images or links.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="extra-important">HTML uses "elements" to describe content</li>
                <li>HTML elements typically have an opening tag, content then a closing tag.</li>
                <li>You can also have span elements like images</li>
                <li class="extra-important">You can configure elements with attributes</li>
                <li class="extra-important">Threr's a long list of available elements by you'll gain expericence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>CSS Summary</h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that allows you to define style definitions
            for your HTML document. These definitions will be picked up by the browser and
            control how the content will be displayed (e.g. that some text is red, which font size
            it should have etc.).</p>
            <ul id="html-lists">
                <li>If anyone wants to begin a career in web designing professionally, it is essential to have knowledge of CSS and HTML.</li>
                <li class="extra-important">With the use of CSS, we can control various styles, such as the text color, the font style, the spacing among paragraphs, column size and layout, background color and images, design of the layout, display variations for distinct screens and device sizes, and many other effects as well.</li>
                <li>CSS has controlling power on the documents of HTML, so it is easy to learn. It is integrated with the HTML and the XHTML markup languages.</li>
                <li class="extra-important">Once we have knowledge of some basics of CSS and HTML, other associated technologies like Angular, PHP, and JavaScript are become clearer to understand.</li>
